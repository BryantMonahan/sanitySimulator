        <h3>What is a Mortgage?</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>A mortgage is a loan that is used to purchase a home. The loan is secured by the home itself, so if the borrower fails to repay the loan, the lender can take 
            possession of the home through a process called foreclosure. Mortgages are typically repaid over a period of 15 to 30 years, with fixed or adjustable interest rates.</p>

        <h3>How Do Mortgages Work?</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>When a borrower applies for a mortgage, the lender will evaluate their creditworthiness, income, and other financial factors to determine how much they can borrow 
            and at what interest rate. The borrower will then make a down payment, which is a percentage of the home's purchase price, and the lender will provide the remaining 
            funds needed to buy the home. The borrower will then make monthly payments to the lender, which will include both principal and interest, until the loan is paid off.</p>

        <h3>Types of Mortgages</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>There are several types of mortgages available, including fixed-rate mortgages, adjustable-rate mortgages, and government-backed loans. Fixed-rate mortgages have 
            a set interest rate for the life of the loan, while adjustable-rate mortgages have interest rates that can change over time. Government-backed loans, such as FHA and VA 
            loans, are designed to help low-income or first-time homebuyers qualify for a mortgage.</p>

        <h3>Why You Should Care</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>The 30-year fixed mortgage rate plays a critical role in home affordability, directly affecting the total cost of borrowing for homeowners. Even a small change in the 
            interest rate can have a significant financial impact over the life of a loan. For example, on a $500,000 mortgage, an increase from 5% to 6% raises the monthly payment 
            by approximately $323 and results in nearly $116,000 more in interest paid over 30 years. This means that even a 1% increase in rates can substantially raise the long-term 
            cost of homeownership. Higher mortgage rates reduce purchasing power, making homes less affordable and slowing demand in the housing market, while lower rates encourage 
            homebuying and refinancing, boosting economic activity. This sensitivity to interest rates is why they are closely monitored by homebuyers, real estate professionals, and policymakers.</p>

            <p>The graph shows the historical trend of the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage average in the United States, based on data from Freddie Mac via FRED. Mortgage rates 
                experienced a sharp increase in the late 1970s, peaking at nearly 18% in the early 1980s due to high inflation and Federal Reserve policies. After this peak, 
                rates declined steadily over the following decades, with occasional fluctuations, particularly in the late 1980s and early 2000s. From 2010 to 2020, rates 
                remained relatively low, reaching historic lows around 2020. However, following this period, mortgage rates rose significantly, reflecting recent economic and 
                monetary policy shifts. The graph also highlights U.S. recessions, which often coincide with changes in mortgage rate trends. </p>

            <p>This graph compares the median sales price of new houses (blue line) and real median household income (red line) in the United States, adjusted for inflation. 
                Over time, housing prices have risen significantly, especially since the 2000s, with sharp increases after 2020. Meanwhile, household income has remained relatively 
                flat, showing only modest growth since the 1970s. This growing disparity indicates that home prices have far outpaced income growth, making housing less affordable 
                for many Americans. The shaded areas mark U.S. recessions, which often coincide with fluctuations in housing prices but have had little impact on long-term income trends. 
                This widening gap suggests increasing financial strain on homebuyers as wages fail to keep pace with rising housing costs.</p>
