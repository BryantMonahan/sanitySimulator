        <h3>What is a Mortgage?</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>A mortgage is a type loan that is specifially used to buy a home. The loan is secured by the home itself,
            which means if the borrower fails to repay the loan, the lender can take possession of the home through a
            process called foreclosure. Mortgages are typically repaid over a period of 15 to 30 years, with fixed or
            adjustable interest rates.
            <br><br>
            Mortgages are large loans which typically take between 15 to 30 years to pay off. When a borrower applies
            for a mortgage, the lender will evaluate their credit history, income, debts and other
            financial factors to determine how much they can borrow and at what interest rate.
            <br><br>
            Typically, the borrower will then make a down payment, which is a percentage of the home's
            purchase price, and the lender will provide the remaining
            funds needed to buy the home. The borrower will then make monthly payments to the lender, which will include
            both principal and interest, until the loan is paid off.

        <h3>Types of Mortgages</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>There are a variety of mortgages on the market, the most common being a fixed mortgage. However,
            there are more types of loans that available to borrowers, the ones listed are just the most common.
        </p>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Fixed-rate mortgage:</strong> A mortgage with a fixed interest rate for the entire term of the
                loan. This is also by far the most common type of mortgage.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM):</strong> A mortgage with an interest rate that is initally
                constant, then after a set time it changes based on market conditions. This could leave borrowers with
                either higher or lower monthly payments than they began with.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>FHA loan:</strong> A government-backed mortgage designed for low-to-moderate-income borrowers.
                This can be a great option for people with lower credit scores or first-time homebuyers, because it
                typically requires a significantly smaller downpayment than a typical loan (as low as 3.5%).</li>
            </li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>VA loan:</strong> A government-backed mortgage available to eligible veterans and active-duty
                service members. To those who qualify, a VA loan can be incredibly enticing as they typically require no
                down payment.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Jumbo loan:</strong> A non-conforming loan that exceeds the limits set by the Federal Housing
                Finance Agency (FHFA), typically used for financing high-value properties. This works similar to
                conventioanl mortgages but lenders have more rigorous requirements. This is becasue when a loan becomes
                large enough it is no longer backed by the government which causes the lender to take on more risk.</li>
            <br>

        <h3>Why You Should Care</h3>
        <hr>
        <p> Mortgage rates play a critical role in home affordability, directly affecting the total
            cost of borrowing for homeowners. Higher mortgage rates reduce purchasing power, making homes less
            affordable and slowing demand in the housing market.
            <br><br>
            Even a small change in the interest rate can have a significant financial impact over the life of a loan.
            For example, on a $500,000 mortgage, an increase from 5% to 6% results in nearly $116,000 more in interest
            paid over 30 years.
            <br><br>
            As rates continue to rise, the impact becomes even more pronnounced. This sensitivity to interest rates is
            why they are closely monitored by homebuyers, real estate professionals, and policymakers.

        <div class="center_elements">
            <p>Mortgage rates experienced a sharp increase in the late 1970s, peaking at nearly 18%. After this peak,
                rates declined steadily over the following decades, reaching historic lows around 2020. However,
                following this period, mortgage rates rose significantly.

            <p>This graph compares the median sales price of new houses (blue line) and real median household income
                (red line) in the United States, adjusted for inflation. Over time, housing prices have risen
                significantly, especially since the 2000s, with sharp increases after 2020.
                <br><br>
                Meanwhile, household income has remained relatively flat, showing only modest growth since the 1970s.
                This growing disparity indicates that home prices have far outpaced income growth, making housing less
                affordable for many Americans.
                <br><br>
                This widening gap suggests increasing financial strain on homebuyers as wages fail to keep pace with
                rising housing costs.
