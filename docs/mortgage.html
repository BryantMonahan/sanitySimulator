        <h3>What is a Mortgage?</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>A mortgage is a type loan that is specifially used to buy a home. The loan is secured by the home itself,
            which means if the borrower fails to repay the loan, the lender can take possession of the home through a
            process called foreclosure. Mortgages are typically repaid over a period of 15 to 30 years, with fixed or
            adjustable interest rates.
            <br><br>
            Mortgages are large loans which typically take between 15 to 30 years to pay off. When a borrower applies
            for a mortgage, the lender will evaluate their credit history, income, debts and other
            financial factors to determine how much they can borrow and at what interest rate.
            <br><br>
            Typically, the borrower will then make a down payment, which is a percentage of the home's
            purchase price, and the lender will provide the remaining
            funds needed to buy the home. The borrower will then make monthly payments to the lender, which will include
            both principal and interest, until the loan is paid off.

        <h3>Types of Mortgages</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>There are a variety of mortgages on the market, the most common being a fixed mortgage. However,
            there are more types of loans that available to borrowers, the ones listed are just the most common.
        </p>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Fixed-rate mortgage:</strong> A mortgage with a fixed interest rate for the entire term of the
                loan. This is also by far the most common type of mortgage.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM):</strong> A mortgage with an interest rate that is initally
                constant, then after a set time it changes based on market conditions. This could leave borrowers with
                either higher or lower monthly payments than they began with.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>FHA loan:</strong> A government-backed mortgage designed for low-to-moderate-income borrowers.
                This can be a great option for people with lower credit scores or first-time homebuyers, because it
                typically requires a significantly smaller downpayment than a typical loan (as low as 3.5%).</li>
            </li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>VA loan:</strong> A government-backed mortgage available to eligible veterans and active-duty
                service members. To those who qualify, a VA loan can be incredibly enticing as they typically require no
                down payment.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Jumbo loan:</strong> A non-conforming loan that exceeds the limits set by the Federal Housing
                Finance Agency (FHFA), typically used for financing high-value properties. This works similar to
                conventioanl mortgages but lenders have more rigorous requirements. This is becasue when a loan becomes
                large enough it is no longer backed by the government which causes the lender to take on more risk.</li>
            <br>

        <h3>What Are Mortgage Rates?</h3>
        <hr>
        <p> A mortgage rate is the interest a lender charges on the amount of money borrowed to buy a home. Mortgage
            rates play a major role in home affordability, directly affecting the total cost of borrowing for
            homeowners. Higher mortgage rates reduce purchasing power, making homes less affordable and slowing demand
            in the housing market.
            <br><br>
            Even a small change in the interest rate can have a significant impact over the life of a loan.
            For example, on a $500,000 mortgage, an increase from 5% to 6% results in nearly $116,000 more in interest
            paid over 30 years.
            <br><br>
            Interest is most commonly felt in the first few years of a mortgage, as the majority of the monthly payment
            goes towards interest rather than the principal. This means if you had an interest rate around 7% and paid
            $20,000 towards your mortgage in the first year, only around $2,600 would actually go towards the principal.
            Infact, at this rate, it would take about 22 years to pay off the first half of the inital loan.
            <br><br>
            This sensitivity to interest rates is why they are closely monitored by homebuyers, real estate
            professionals, policymakers, and now you. If you decide to take out a mortgage with a high interest rate,
            it's important to know that you can refinance your loan later on at a later date with a lower rate.
            <br><br>
            Below is a graph of the median 30-year fixed mortgage rate from 1990 to now. I'd highly recommend using the
            calculator at the top of this page to see how the interest rates affects not only your monthly payment,
            but also the total cost of a loan.

        <p>This graph compares the median sales price of new houses (blue line) and real median household income
            (red line) in the United States, adjusted for inflation. Over time, housing prices have risen
            significantly, especially since the 2000s, with sharp increases after 2020.
            <br><br>
            Meanwhile, household income has remained relatively flat, showing only modest growth since the 1970s.
            This growing disparity indicates that home prices have far outpaced income growth, making housing less
            affordable for many Americans.
            <br><br>
            This widening gap suggests increasing financial strain on homebuyers as wages fail to keep pace with
            rising housing costs.
