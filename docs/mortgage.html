        <h3>What is a Mortgage?</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>A mortgage is a loan that is used to purchase a home. The loan is secured by the home itself, so if the
            borrower fails to repay the loan, the lender can take
            possession of the home through a process called foreclosure. Mortgages are typically repaid over a period of
            15 to 30 years, with fixed or adjustable interest rates.

        <h3>How Do Mortgages Work?</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>When a borrower applies for a mortgage, the lender will evaluate their creditworthiness, income, and other
            financial factors to determine how much they can borrow
            and at what interest rate. The borrower will then make a down payment, which is a percentage of the home's
            purchase price, and the lender will provide the remaining
            funds needed to buy the home. The borrower will then make monthly payments to the lender, which will include
            both principal and interest, until the loan is paid off.

        <h3>Why You Should Care</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>The 30-year fixed mortgage rate plays a critical role in home affordability, directly affecting the total
            cost of borrowing for homeowners. Even a small change in the
            interest rate can have a significant financial impact over the life of a loan.
            <br><br>
            For example, on a $500,000 mortgage, an increase from 5% to 6% raises the monthly payment
            by approximately $323 and results in nearly $116,000 more in interest paid over 30 years. This means that
            even a 1% increase in rates can substantially raise the long-term
            cost of homeownership.
            <br><br>
            Higher mortgage rates reduce purchasing power, making homes less affordable and slowing demand in the
            housing market, while lower rates encourage
            homebuying and refinancing, boosting economic activity. This sensitivity to interest rates is why they are
            closely monitored by homebuyers, real estate professionals, and policymakers.

        <div class="center_elements">
            <p>Mortgage rates experienced a sharp increase in the late 1970s, peaking at nearly 18%. After this peak,
                rates declined steadily over the following decades, reaching historic lows around 2020. However,
                following this period, mortgage rates rose significantly.

            <p>This graph compares the median sales price of new houses (blue line) and real median household income
                (red line) in the United States, adjusted for inflation.
                Over time, housing prices have risen significantly, especially since the 2000s, with sharp increases
                after 2020.
                <br><br>
                Meanwhile, household income has remained relatively
                flat, showing only modest growth since the 1970s. This growing disparity indicates that home prices have
                far outpaced income growth, making housing less affordable
                for many Americans.
                <br><br>
                This widening gap suggests increasing financial strain on homebuyers as wages fail to keep pace with
                rising housing costs.
