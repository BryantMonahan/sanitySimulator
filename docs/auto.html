        <h3>What is an Auto Loan?</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>An auto loan is a type of loan used to purchase a vehicle that a borrower can't afford to buy outright.
            This loan allows the borrower to pay an up-front portion (usually around 20%) to the lender and the lender
            provides the remaining portion of the cost to the seller.
            <br><br>
            In exchange for providing the rest of the cost,
            the buyer will repay the lender over a period of time (anywhere from 24 to 84 months) while paying interest
            on the amount of money owed to the lender.

        <h3>Depreciation</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>
            A car is not an investment, and it will lose value over time. This loss in value is called depreciation and
            is typically quite steep for newer vehicles.
            <br><br>
            On average, a new car loses about 20% of its value in the first year and 10%-15% each subsequent year.
            It's important for potential buyers to understand that vehicles are not investments and will cost money to
            maintain while losing value over time.
        </p>
        <div class="graph_holder">
            <div class="graph">
                <div id="depreciationGraph" class="normal_graph"></div>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>
            However, depreciation can be used in a buyer's advantage if they wait to buy a car until it is a few years
            old, as the price will be significantly lower than the original MSRP. For example, a car that costs $40,000
            new may be available for around $25,000 after only three years.
            <br><br>
            It's important to note that depreciation is not linear, and that most loss (or gain depending on if you're
            buying) occurs in the first few years. The value lost after the seventh year is nowhere near the same as in
            the first.
            <br><br>
            <!--https://caredge.com/ranks/depreciation/popular/5-year/best source for this data-->
            Furthermore, different cars depreciate at different rates, and some cars even appreciate in value
            over time. For example, on average, after 5 years a Toyota will have retained around 63% of its value,
            while a Jeep will have only retained about 46%.
            <br><br>
            Typically, a cars depreciation can be linked to its reliability, and the more reliable cars depreciate less.
            This is why reliable brands like Toyota, Lexus (owned by Toyota), and Honda tend to have a better resale
            value. If you're interested in comparing brands and models, <a

        <h3>Why You Should Care</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>For example, an average new car loan with a loan amount of $40,000 and an average interest rate of 7.2% over
            69 months could result in almost $9,000 in interest paid over the life of the loan.
            This is a significant amount of money that could be used for other purposes, such as saving for retirement
            or paying off other debts.
            <br><br>
            By understanding the costs associated with auto loans, borrowers can make more informed decisions about
            their financing options and potentially save money in the long run.
