        <h3>What is Credit/Credit Score?</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>Credit is how likely you are to repay borrowed money. This is often displayed as a number between 300 and
            850. Think of it as your financial GPA. The higher the number, the better your credit is.
            <br><br>
            This score will determine if you're eligible for loans like credit cards, auto loans, and mortgages. It will
            also determine the interest rate you will pay on these loans. A higher score means a lower interest rate,
            which can save you thousands of dollars over the life of a loan.
            <br><br>
            For some jobs having a good credit score is a requirement. This is especially true for jobs in finance,
            banking, insurance, and law enforcement.

        <h3>What Makes Up Your Credit Score?</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>Your credit score is made up of five different factors. These factors are weighted differently, meaning some
            have a larger impact on your score than others.
            The five factors are:
        </p>
        <!-- I'd like to add a pretty pie chart here once I get more comfortable with JS-->
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Payment History (35%):</strong> This is the most important factor. It shows if you pay your
                bills on time.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Credit Utilization (30%):</strong> This is the amount of credit you are using compared to the
                amount of credit you have available.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Length of Credit History (15%):</strong> This is how long you've had credit accounts open.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Types of Credit (10%):</strong> This is the different types of credit accounts you have, such as
                credit cards, mortgages, and auto loans.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>New Credit (10%):</strong> This is the number of new credit accounts you've opened recently.
            </li>
            <br>
        </ul>
        <p>
            As of writing this article, credit utilization is based on the most recent month so your credit score can
            seem volatile if you are using more credit than usual. However, once you pay off your credit card, your
            score should return to normal within a month or two.
            <br><br>
            If you are looking to improve your credit score, the best thing you can do is pay your bills on time. This
            will have the largest impact on your score and if possible, it may be better for your credit score to keep
            line of credits open even if you are not using them. This will help your credit utilization ratio and length
            of credit history (assuming it's not costing money to keep them open).
        </p>

        <h3>What is APR?</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>
            APR stands for Annual Percentage Rate and is the total cost of borrowing money from a lender per year.
            This includes the interest rate and any fees associated with the loan.
            <br><br>
            For example, if you have a $10,000 loan from one lender at 30% APR, you'll end up paying them $3,000 in one
            year on fees and interest. All lenders are required to disclose this number and it's a good way to compare
            different loans.
            <br><br>
            The graph below shows the average interest rate for credit cards. This does not include any fees that may be
            associated with the cards so the APR is likely higher than what is shown in the graph. While your APR will
            depend on your credit score, it will still increase and decrease with the average.

        <h3>The Minimum Payment Trap</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>
            The minimum monthly payment is an amount of money decided by a lender that a borrower needs to pay to keep
            their account in good standing and avoid late fees and negative impacts on their credit score. This is
            usually the interest owed plus a small percentage of the total balance, typically between 1% and 4%.
            <br><br>
            While this may seem like a good option to someone in financial trouble, it will probably only keep them in
            debt. This is because the minimum payment is rarely enough to pay off the balance in a reasonable amount
            of time.
            <br><br>
            Many people either aren't financially literate enough to understand the consequences of only paying
            the minimum payment, or they are in a situation where they can't afford to pay any more.
            Credit card companies are aware of this and will often advertise the minimum payment as a way to entice
            people to take on more debt.
