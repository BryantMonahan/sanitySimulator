        <h3>What is Credit/Credit Score?</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>Credit is how likely you are to repay borrowed money. This is often displayed as a number between 300 and
            850. Think of it as your financial GPA. The higher the number, the better your credit is.
            <br><br>
            This score will determine if you're eligible for loans like credit cards, auto loans, and mortgages. It will
            also determine the interest rate you will pay on these loans. A higher score means a lower interest rate,
            which can save you thousands of dollars over the life of a loan.
            <br><br>
            There are two main types of credit scores, FICO and Vantage, and three credit bureaus that determine credit
            scores: Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion. Due to FICO scores being the go-to for 90% of lenders we'll be
            focusing on that. However, if you're interested in Vantage or would like to explore more <a

            interest.

            If you're interested in seeing how you stack up against the general population, you can always get a free
            credit report at <a href="www.annualcreditreport.com" target="_blank">www.annualcreditreport.com</a> or
            any other trusted source like Experian, Equifax, or CreditKarma. Furthermore, these reports will show you
            what accounts have been opened under your name and could reveal unknown fraud.

        <h3>What Makes Up Your Credit Score?</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>Your credit score is made up of five different factors. These factors are weighted differently, meaning some
            have a larger impact on your score than others.
            The five factors are:
        </p>
        <!-- I'd like to add a pretty pie chart here once I get more comfortable with JS-->
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Payment History (35%):</strong> This is the most important factor. It shows if you pay your
                bills on time.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Credit Utilization (30%):</strong> This is the amount of credit you are using compared to the
                amount of credit you have available.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Length of Credit History (15%):</strong> This is how long you've had credit accounts open.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Types of Credit (10%):</strong> This is the different types of credit accounts you have, such as
                credit cards, mortgages, and auto loans.</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>New Credit (10%):</strong> This is the number of new credit accounts you've opened recently.
            </li>
            <br>
        </ul>
        <p>
            As of writing this article, credit utilization is based on the most recent month so your credit score can
            seem volatile if you are using more credit than usual. However, once you pay off your credit card, your
            score should return to normal within a month or two.
            <br><br>
            If you are looking to improve your credit score, the best thing you can do is pay your bills on time. This
            will have the largest impact on your score and if possible, it may be better for your credit score to keep
            line of credits open even if you are not using them. This will help your credit utilization ratio and length
            of credit history (assuming it's not costing money to keep them open).
