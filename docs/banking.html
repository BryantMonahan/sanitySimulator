        <h3>Saving: The 50/30/20 rule</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>The 50/30/20 rule isn't so much as a rule as it is a general go-to budgeting guideline. The idea is that
            you should spend 50% of your income on needs, 30% on wants, and 20% on savings or paying back debt. However,
            it is important
            to remember that this is just a guideline and you should adjust it to fit your own financial situation.

        <h3>Simple vs Compount Interest & Inlfation</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>When saving money, it's important to know your APY. APY is the total amount of interest you'll earn on a
            savings or
            investment account taking compounding into account. There are two types of interest: simple and compound.
            <br><br>
            Simple interest is
            calculated only on the principal amount, while compound interest is calculated on the principal and any
            interest that has already
            been added to the account.
            <br><br>
            Another factor to take into account when saving money is inflation. Inflation is the rate at which the
            general level of prices
            for goods and services is rising, which subsequently decreases the worth of your money. This generally
            averages out to around 3%
            per year, but can vary based on the economy.
            <br><br>
            If your APY is lower than the inflation rate, you are losing money over time. The average savings rate is
            around .41% APY which is
            significantly lower than the average inflation rate. The solution to this is a high-yield savings account or
            a money market account
            which can offer APYs of 4% or higher.
            <br><br>
            These accounts are typically offered by online banks and credit unions, and they can help you
            keep up with inflation while still earning interest on your savings. A simple Google search can find you a
            bank (insured by the FDIC)
            that offers a high-yield savings account with a competitive APY.
            <br><br>
            I strongly encourage you to play around with the calculator below to see the differnce between simple and
            compounding
            interest and the impact
            that inflation has on the real value of your money.

        <h3>Banks vs Credit Unions</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>Banks and credit unions are both financial institutions that offer similar services, such as checking and
            savings accounts,
            loans, and credit cards. However, there are some key differences between the two.
            <br><br>
            Banks are for-profit institutions that are owned by shareholders, while credit unions are non-profit
            organizations that
            are owned by their members. This means that credit unions typically offer lower fees and better interest
            rates than banks.
            <br><br>
            Furthermore, some credit unions have membership requirements, such as living in a certain area or working
            for a specific employer.
            This can make it more difficult to join a credit union than a bank.
            <br><br>
            If you're looking for a new bank or credit union, I recommend doing some research to find one that fits your
            needs.
            You can use websites like Bankrate or NerdWallet to compare rates and fees.

        <h3>What does FDIC insured mean?</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>The FDIC is the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, an independent agency of the United States government
            that provides
            deposit insurance to depositors in U.S. commercial banks and savings institutions.
            <br><br>
            This means that if your bank fails, the FDIC will reimburse you for your deposits up to $250,000 per
            depositor, per insured bank.
            This insurance is funded by premiums paid by banks and savings institutions, not taxpayers.
            <br><br>
            It's important to note that not all financial institutions are FDIC insured. Be sure to check if your bank
            or credit union is
            insured before opening an account.
